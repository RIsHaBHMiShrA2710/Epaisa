## Database

The application uses a managed PostgreSQL instance on Render. Contributors work locally against the schema defined in the `server/backup.dump` or migrations. Schema changes should be submitted as SQL migration files and will be applied to the Render database after PR approval.

---

## Deployment

* **Frontend**: Merges into `main` auto‐deploy to Netlify at `https://epaisa.netlify.app`. Preview deploys created for pull requests.
* **Backend & Database**: Merges into `main` trigger rebuild and restart on Render. The existing database instance remains until migrations are applied.
